## Data Analytics 2018 - Programming and Scripting Module - Problem Sets
This repository contains the solutions to the weekly problem sets. 


### Topic 1 & 2 - Exercise 1 & 2
File:- [EX-1-2.py](./blob/master/EX-1-2.py)

#### Problem Requirement - Exercise 1
Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. 

#### Problem Requirement - Exercise 2
Using fibname.py, change the string variable to contain your own surname and rerun it. Can you figure out what ord() does?

### Topic 3 - Exercise 3 - Collatz Conjecture
File:- [EX3-Collatz-Conjecture.py](./blob/master/EX3-Collatz-Conjecture.py)

#### Problem Requirement - Exercise 3
Write a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. 
If you wish to enhance your program, have the program ask the user for the integer instead of specifying a value at the start of your code.

### Topic 4 - Exercise 4 - Euler Project Problem 5
File:- [EX4-Euler-Project-5.py](.blob/master/EX4-Euler-Project-5.py)

#### Problem Requirement - Exercise 4
Write a Python program using for and range to calculate the solution to the Euler Project Problem 5 which is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.

### Topic 5 - Exercise 5 - Read & Format Iris Dataset
File:- [EX5-Iris-data-formatting.py](.blob/master/EX5-Iris-data-formatting.py)

#### Problem Requirement - Exercise 5
Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.

### Topic 6 - Exercise 6 - Factorial Function
File:- [EX6-Factorial-Function.py](.blob/master/EX6-Factorial-Function.py)

#### Problem Requirement - Exercise 6
Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
