# My name is Gerard, so the first and last letter of my name (G + D = 7 + 4) give the number 11.
# The 11th Fibonacci number is 89.

# ord() is a built in Python function. The method takes a character input and returns an integer number
# which is a numerical representation of the character in the American Standard Code for 
# Information Interchange [ASCII] character set. 
# This is how computers understand characters - as a numerical representation [in binary].
